# AI Academy Semester 1 Capstone Project


# Project Overview:

## Business Understanding: 

§ Stakeholders/ Key business Question: 

   ► Computing Vision is in a competitive industry and is looking to expand its business by creating original video content. The company has decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t have much background in creating movies. As         Deloitte professionals, we are responsible for exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box    office using different samples of available data. After conducting extensive data analysis, our team will translate        those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.




## Data Understanding & Analysis:

#### Source of Data:
§ IMDB:
        
        ► Database that contains information from the IMDB website, including general movie information. The data was collected within the SQL database, using the movies_basics, movie_ratings, directors, and persons tables and joined with the respective movie IDs

§ Numbers & TheMovieDB:
        
        ► Datasets that contain information about movie popularity, movie budget, and total grossing information from themoviedb.org and the-numbers.com.

§ Finalized Data Frame used for Analysis:
        
        ► Finalized data frame combines the information from these two sources of data, as well as profit calculations.

#### Description of Data:
§ Genre Prioritization: 
        
        ► Based on the data analysis, Computing Vision should prioritize Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi films 
        
        ► The profits for these genres based on the analysis are the following:
            
            ► Animation: $250 million
            
            ► Adventure: $229 million
            
            ► Sci-fi: $202 million

§ Directorship Prioritization:
        ► Top 8 directors (produced 5+ movies) that have the highest average gross profit across movies they directed *doesn't  take genre into account* 
        ► Top 3 Directors:
            ► Joss Whedon $1.46 billion
            ► Anthony Russo $1.30 billion
