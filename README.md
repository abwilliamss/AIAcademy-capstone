# AIAcademy Capstone Project
Business Project: Computing Vision (a made-up company for the purposes of this project) sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t have much background in creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office using different samples of available data. You then will translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

Main Question to Answer: What film genres are doing the best in box office? How can Computing Vision leverage this information to inform what kind of films they should create
